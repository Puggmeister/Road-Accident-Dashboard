# Road-Accident-Dashboard
In this Capstone project, the stakeholders aimed to determine the severity of the casualties from 2021 to 2022 and find out the cause of those accidents. And with the use of Sort and Filter, I was able to determine the factors that caused most road accidents from the years 2021-2023.
